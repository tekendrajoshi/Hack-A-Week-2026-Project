## How the app should be: 
1. There should be 1st subpage where you get the qns posted by other students of similar level .... also option to add my qn 
there should be option to answer the qn posted by anyone(like commeenting in fb) there should be like button (this isq bcuz if someone clicks that the points of the user who answered increases)

2. Anoher sub page should be the help option where we normally get the qns uploaded by the juniors same system of answering there too... 

3. Third sub page should be the contribution leaderboard ... where there is list of the users (ranked on the basis  of points: this acts as a motivation for saomeone to answer that  there are chances that  someone miht get offer of home tution cuz more points ensures better tutor ...thus our app also provides a platform where the student like us get opportunities of earning too cuz many people are searching for good hoe tuetion tutor for their child ) 
(These above all things are public both posts and comments and leaderboard) 

4. Also by clicking on the profile of the person who commented one should be able to either msg or call ... on message also they can discuss and on  call there should be audio call + same whiteboard visible to both)  If  call and whiteboard or sharing screen features are not able to add now we can link to whatsapp for now in MVP and later on we can add.
